  <li>Describe what's needed to turn this text into valid, parsable JSON:
    <pre>
[
  {
    id: 7,
    type: 1,  // cat
    name: 'Fluffy',
    trainable: false,
    birthDate: '5/7/05',
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    type: 2,  // dog
    name: 'Spot',
    trainable: true,
    birthDate: "\/Date(1336460400000)\/",
    adoptionDate: '2012-11-23T00:00:00-08:00',
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    type: 1,
    name: 'Boris',
    trainable: false,
    birthDate: '',
    adoptionDate: '2014-06-09T07:00:00Z'
  }
]</pre>
    <h2>Please read all of the following instructions before proceeding.</h2>
  </li>
  <li>Write/describe how would you retrieve this data from an API endpoint <a href="http://demo8429909.mockable.io/animals" target="_blank"><code>http://demo8429909.mockable.io/animals</code></a>?</li>
  <li>Create JS structure (model/view-model/etc) that reflects the data structure specified above, along with the following:
    <ul>
      <li>A method that returns text version of the animal <code>type</code>: "cat", "dog", as indicated in the text comments above.</li>
      <li>Property/method <code>isAdopted</code>.</li>
      <li>Property/method <code>age</code> (in months).</li>
      <li>Maintain <code>trainable</code> as a private property. It will not be exposed in the UI.</li>
      <li>Method <code>speak</code> that uses <code>trainable</code> property to return the animal's appropriate response.
        (if you ever tried to teach your cat to "speak", you'd know their response ;)</li>
      <li>Method <code>adopt</code> that lets the user adopt that animal <small>(or at least starts that process &ndash;
        uploading paperwork is not part of this excercise)</small>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Write/describe unit tests for this.
    <ul>
      <li><em>(bonus)</em> How would you <strong>unit</strong> test the API request?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>(bonus 2)</em> Generate a list of adopted cats' names.</li>
</ol>

4. In order to unit test the api endpoint you could have a known response object and make the request to the service which you would compare and validate it equals the known.
