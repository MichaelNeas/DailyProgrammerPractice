# CompSci Daily
## Daily questions for newcomers ðŸ˜„

Comp Sci daily has begun from desire to learn new things in our slack group! The following will be a list of the proposed new cool technologies and a short reading to follow up.

### Day0: SSHFS, try to get it working too
```
A tool that mounts and allows interaction with remote directories and contents.  This technology is made available by SFTP and SSH.

### Day1: Ascii vs Unicode
```
Ascii is 2^8 bit encoding to represent 128 characters
Unicode is masssssive  < 2^21 bit encoding and has emojis and a ton of different symbols (edited) 
Further studies: what does UTF stand for and what are popular encodings for it?
    Stands for "Unicode Transformation Format." UTF refers to several types of Unicode character encodings, including UTF-7, UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32.

Introspection - Examine types or properties of an object at runtime
Reflection - Goes a step further and allows manipulation of the values, data, props of an object at runtime.
