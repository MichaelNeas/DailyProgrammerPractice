    <p>maxCount()
Write a method maxCount() that returns the number of occurrences of the most frequently occurring value in an array of integers.

For example, suppose we have an array with the sequence of values:

[1, 3, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 11, 14, 14, 14]
maxCount() should return 4 to indicate that the most frequently occurring value occurs 4 times.</p>

<p>"em" Pro: Scales as font scales</p>
<p>"em" Con: Getting exact pixel sizes to line up objects is difficult</p>

<h3>Explain the off by 1 error and how i would test it.</h3>
<p>The 1 off error occured because I was attempting to compare an out of bounds element in the array.  To combat that I set temp = 1 when the loop resets to count singleton and initial items in the pattern</p>
<p>In order to test this out I would unit test my maxCount function, under the given assumption that this array is always sorted and always contains numbers as elements. (otherwise I would write conditionals and tests for those situations)
    <ul>
      <li>0 elements</li>
      <li>1 element</li>
      <li>many elements</li>
      <li>many same elements</li>
      <li>max elements</li>
    </ul>
