<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href='#'>List1</a></li>
    <li><a href='#'>List2</a></li>
    <li><a href='#'>List3</a></li>
    <li><a href='#'>List4</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
<div>
  You can also nest elements in the scss just like you would with html.
</div>
<div>
  Partials are snipbits of css that you import into other sass files to allow modularity, indicated by underscores.  Every import creates an http request, but you can break up sass and make it modular.

<div class="box">
  Mixins allow for group declarations that you can reuse through your site. Declare @mixin and use @include to use it.

  @extend lets you share a set of css from one to another and "extend" the class on action

  Error
</div>
<div class='warning'>
