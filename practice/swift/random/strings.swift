/// String interpolation is a way to construct a new String value from a mix of constants, variables, literals, and expressions by including their values inside a string literal. You can use string interpolation in both single-line and multiline string literals. 
/// Each item that you insert into the string literal is wrapped in a pair of parentheses, prefixed by a backslash (\):
let multiplier = 3
let message = "\(multiplier) times 2.5 is \(Double(multiplier) * 2.5)"
// message is "3 times 2.5 is 7.5"

/// The letter √© can be represented as the single Unicode scalar √© (LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE, or U+00E9).
/// However, the same letter can also be represented as a pair of scalars‚Äîa standard letter e (LATIN SMALL LETTER E, 
/// or U+0065), followed by the COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT scalar (U+0301). The COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT scalar is 
/// graphically applied to the scalar that precedes it, turning an e into an √© when it‚Äôs rendered by a Unicode-aware 
// text-rendering system.

let eAcute: Character = "\u{E9}"                         // √©
let combinedEAcute: Character = "\u{65}\u{301}"          // e followed by ÃÅ
// eAcute is √©, combinedEAcute is √©


/// Extended grapheme clusters are a flexible way to represent many complex script characters as a single Character value. 
/// For example, Hangul syllables from the Korean alphabet can be represented as either a precomposed or decomposed sequence. 
/// Both of these representations qualify as a single Character value in Swift:

let precomposed: Character = "\u{D55C}"                  // Ìïú
let decomposed: Character = "\u{1112}\u{1161}\u{11AB}"   // ·Ñí, ·Ö°, ·Ü´
// precomposed is Ìïú, decomposed is Ìïú

/// Unicode scalars for regional indicator symbols can be combined in pairs to make a single Character value, 
/// such as this combination of REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER U (U+1F1FA) and REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL 
/// LETTER S (U+1F1F8):

let regionalIndicatorForUS: Character = "\u{1F1FA}\u{1F1F8}"
// regionalIndicatorForUS is üá∫üá∏


/// If you initialize a new string with the four-character word cafe, 
/// and then append a COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (U+0301) to the end of the string,
/// the resulting string will still have a character count of 4, with a fourth character of √©, not e:

var word = "cafe"
print("the number of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")
// Prints "the number of characters in cafe is 4"

word += "\u{301}"    // COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT, U+0301

print("the number of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")
// Prints "the number of characters in caf√© is 4"

/* Note

Extended grapheme clusters can be composed of multiple Unicode scalars. 
This means that different characters‚Äîand different representations of the same character‚Äîcan 
require different amounts of memory to store. Because of this, characters in Swift don‚Äôt each 
take up the same amount of memory within a string‚Äôs representation. As a result, the number of 
characters in a string can‚Äôt be calculated without iterating through the string to determine its 
extended grapheme cluster boundaries. If you are working with particularly long string values, 
be aware that the count property must iterate over the Unicode scalars in the entire string in 
order to determine the characters for that string.

The count of the characters returned by the count property isn‚Äôt always the same as the length property 
of an NSString that contains the same characters. The length of an NSString is based on the number of 
16-bit code units within the string‚Äôs UTF-16 representation and not the number of Unicode extended 
grapheme clusters within the string.

/*
You can use the insert(_:at:), insert(contentsOf:at:), remove(at:), and removeSubrange(_:) methods 
on any type that conforms to the RangeReplaceableCollection protocol. 
This includes String, as shown here, as well as collection types such as Array, Dictionary, and Set.

Both String and Substring conform to the StringProtocol protocol, which means it‚Äôs often 
convenient for string-manipulation functions to accept a StringProtocol value.
 You can call such functions with either a String or Substring value.
